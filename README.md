# 100DaysOfCode

**100DaysOfCode is a challenge/community, where you publicly commit to code for 1 hour for the next 100 days.**

## Rules

- In our version, of 100DaysOfCode, you need to do anything that helps you enhance your tech stack i.e. competitive coding, try learning a new language, read technical articles/ books, make open source contributions, add features to a personal project, etc.
- It's okay if you are not able to submit a pull request someday, you can resume it the next day, you will still be in the competition. Remember, *life is not a sprint but a marathon, so is the path to learning and growning*.
- Keep defining your short term goals (measurable) and strive hard to achieve them.
(Eg. Getting better at competitive coding is not a measurable goal but achiving 2000 rating in Codechef is measurable)
- Update everyday progress and submit a pull request.
- (Optional) Follow [100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag and timely tweet your progress with #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

- Try to add detailed description of what you did, add corresponding links, if you solve questions, you can add your codes in the same folder and provid a link in the README (not for active contests).
- We start the marathon on January 1, 2020. feel free to add your goals beforehand (they can also be added later).

## Benefits

- Your GitHub profile will look extremely active. And yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these.
- You’ll get more comfortable contributing in open soruce. It will become a natural, ordinary thing to do.
- You’ll have a pretty good reason to stop procrastinating and start coding every day.

- Increase your efficiency by checking your daily progress and analysing it.
- Compare your progress with others and surpass your limits in learning each day.
